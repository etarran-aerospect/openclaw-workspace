# MEMORY.md — Long-term memory (curated)

## People
- Ethan — precision viticulture & GIS analyst; drone imagery processing for Northern California vineyards (thermal + multispectral).

## Preferences / Boundaries
- Never delete/overwrite files or folders without explicit approval; do a dry run first.

## Workflow
- OpenClaw workspace is synced via git repo `git@github.com:etarran-aerospect/openclaw-workspace.git`.
- Habit: `git pull --rebase` before starting work; commit + push after sessions so both machines stay in sync.

## Setup notes
- Primary chat surface: Telegram DM.
- Desktop: agent identity `Claw-Desktop`.
- Laptop: separate OpenClaw instance named `Claw-Laptop`.
- Conway integration for this setup uses `mcporter` + `conway-terminal` (not `mcpServers` in `openclaw.json` on current tested builds).

## Active project notes
- AeroSpect website migration prep completed on 2026-02-26 with a packaged handoff for Lovable in `reports/website-handoff-2026-02-26/` (prompts, NDVI overlay TypeScript data, and asset checklist). Continue from this package in the next session.
