# Simplification Recommendations for AeroSpect

## 1. Structural Simplification
- **Single-Page Layout:** Convert the site into a sleek, single-page scrolling experience. This removes the need for a complex navigation menu and keeps the user focused on the narrative.
- **Sticky Header:** A minimal sticky header with just the Logo and a "Contact Us" button.

## 2. Content Consolidation
- **Hero Section:** Keep the strong headline but simplify the sub-headline.
- **The "Why" & "How":** Merge "Aerial Intelligence" and "Why Choose Us" into a single "Our Approach" section. Use 3 clear icons/points: Precision, Sustainability, AI-Efficiency.
- **Services Grid:** Instead of 6 separate blocks with individual buttons, use a clean 3x2 or 2x3 grid with concise descriptions. Remove the "View Services" buttons if they just lead to the same information.
- **Pricing:** Replace the long text with a simple "Value-Based Pricing" section. Mention that quotes are tailored to vineyard size and specific needs.
- **Call to Action (CTA):** Make the "Free Aerial Assessment" the primary CTA, appearing in the hero and at the bottom.

## 3. Visual Modernization
- **Clean Palette:** Use a professional palette of Deep Green (Viticulture), Slate Gray (Technology), and plenty of White space.
- **Typography:** Use a modern sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Roboto) for readability.
- **Imagery:** Use high-quality, full-width images sparingly to break up sections, rather than many small images.

## 4. Technical Improvements
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the site is perfectly optimized for mobile, as many vineyard managers may view it on the go.
- **Fast Loading:** Use optimized images and minimal code to ensure near-instant load times.
