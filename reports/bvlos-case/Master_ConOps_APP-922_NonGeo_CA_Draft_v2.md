MASTER CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS) — APP-922 NON-GEO CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL BVLOS
Document ID: CONOPS-APP922-CA-NONGEO-v2
Date: 2026-02-25
Operator: Ethan Tarran / Vineyard Drone Services
UAS System: DJI Dock 2 + DJI Matrice 3D/3TD + FlightHub 2
Requested Waiver Scope: 14 CFR §107.31 and VO-support operations consistent with §107.33 as applicable
Operating Region: State of California (qualified agricultural sites only)

1) Purpose and Operational Intent
- This ConOps defines day-only BVLOS agricultural monitoring over qualified commercial vineyard/permanent-crop properties in California.
- Operations are non-site-specific only after each site is qualified through the Site Qualification Procedure (Section 8).
- Residential/urban dense-population operations are excluded.

2) Operational Envelope (Hard Limits)
- Day operations in VMC only.
- Maximum altitude: 400 ft AGL (site/mission may impose lower cap).
- Flights confined to approved Operational Volume (OV).
- Geofence/geocage enabled before launch.
- RPIC must be in CONUS for CA operations.
- VO support required unless equivalent approved mitigation is documented.
- Abort/terminate on traffic conflict, surveillance degradation, C2 degradation, or unresolved non-participant ingress.

3) Crew and Command Structure
3.1 RPIC (Remote)
- Final authority for launch/continue/terminate/recover decisions.
- Monitors telemetry, geofence status, C2 health, and alerts.
- Executes avoidance/contingency actions upon VO callout or system alert.

3.2 Visual Observer (On-site)
- Located at pre-qualified vantage location(s) with required viewshed.
- Performs continuous airspace and ground surveillance.
- Provides mandatory traffic/hazard callouts to RPIC.

3.3 Communications
- Primary method: cellular voice or dedicated radio (site-defined).
- Backup method: alternate channel (second phone/radio path).
- Loss of both channels requires immediate mission termination and recovery.

4) Detect-and-Avoid (DAA) Concept
4.1 DAA Layers
- Primary tactical DAA: on-site VO visual scan and immediate callouts.
- Supplemental awareness: ADS-B In / AirSense cooperative target cues.
- Procedural containment: route constraints + geofence/geocage + abort matrix.

4.2 Minimum Detection Distance Standard
- Minimum practical detection objective for manned-aircraft conflict evaluation: >= 0.5 statute mile (target) for approach/crossing traffic, or earlier distance required by site conditions.
- If VO cannot maintain sufficient surveillance quality to support timely avoidance, operation shall not launch or shall terminate.

4.3 Avoidance Action Matrix
- RPIC response options: hold, descend within OV, immediate return/recovery, or immediate landing at pre-identified LRS/contingency area.
- Default response under uncertainty: conservative termination/recovery.

5) Route of Flight and OV Management
- Routes are preplanned and constrained within approved OV.
- Route planning checks include boundaries, no-fly constraints, obstacle clearance, and C2 coverage expectations.
- Route changes affecting risk assumptions require survey/hazard-log update before flight.

6) Ground Risk Controls
- Operations limited to private/access-controlled agricultural properties or controlled ROW.
- Non-participant exclusion by procedural controls and preflight clearing.
- Operations terminate if non-participant ingress cannot be resolved.

7) C2 Reliability and Lost Link
- Preflight C2 health verification in GCS/FlightHub.
- Site qualification includes C2 coverage validation method (planning evidence and/or measured checks).
- Lost-link behavior set to safe contingency (RTH or approved equivalent).
- Repeated C2 anomalies trigger site requalification before further operations.

8) Site Qualification Procedure (SQP) — Non-Geo California
- A site must be qualified and documented before initial operations.
- Records are retained and available to FAA upon request.

8.1 Qualification Criteria
Each site must document at minimum:
- Site identity (address and/or lat/long).
- Airspace class (Class G unless COA obtained).
- Boundaries and OV definition.
- Roadways/access points and non-participant exposure.
- Highest obstacles and obstruction profile.
- VO position(s), viewshed factors, and required VO count.
- Dock/LRS locations.
- C2 signal sufficiency across route/OV.
- Max downrange distance from dock/GCS.
- Airports/heliports/aviation activity within 3 SM.
- ADS-B In usage and limitations.
- Applicable mitigations for identified hazards.

8.2 Qualification Workflow
- Conduct documented site survey (form in Appendix A).
- Compare survey results against hazard log/risk baseline.
- Add new hazards and mitigations where needed.
- Determine Go/No-Go for initial qualification.
- RPIC sign/date approval and retain records.

8.3 Requalification Triggers
- Significant infrastructure or land-use change.
- New aviation activity nearby.
- Material route/OV change.
- Repeated safety event/contingency trigger.

9) Weather and Environmental Minimums
- Day VMC only.
- No launch under degraded visibility or conditions reducing VO effectiveness (smoke/glare/haze).
- Terminate/recover if conditions degrade below acceptable margin.

10) Compliance Statement
- All unwaived Part 107 requirements remain in effect.
- Part 89 requirements remain in effect.
- This ConOps applies only to operations matching qualified site profile and constraints herein.

11) Records Retention
- Retain Site Qualification Forms, route/OV map references, risk analysis updates, crew briefings/checklists, and significant-event/corrective-action records.
- Retain for duration of operations at the site and provide to FAA on request.
