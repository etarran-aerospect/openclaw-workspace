# Draft RFI Response — APP-922

**To:** FAA Part 107 Waiver Team (via ASP task: “Submit Request for Information (RFI) Response”)  
**Applicant:** Ethan Tarran  
**Application:** APP-922  
**Date:** 2026-02-25

Dear Part 107 Waiver Team,

Thank you for the Request for Information. Please accept this response and attached revised documents for APP-922.

## 1) Route of flight and factors affecting C2 / people / obstructions
We revised the ConOps to define route qualification and approval for non-site-specific operations. Routes are constrained to an approved Operational Volume (OV) and are evaluated against:
- site boundaries and no-fly constraints,
- obstacle profile,
- non-participant exposure and access points,
- C2 sufficiency across route/OV.

## 2) Site qualification procedure for non-site-specific operations
We added a formal **Site Qualification Procedure (SQP)** in the revised ConOps and attached a **Site Qualification Form** template. Prior to initial operations at each site, we document:
- hazards, boundaries, no-fly areas,
- airspace classification,
- obstructions,
- roads/access points and people exposure,
- VO placement/viewshed,
- C2 validation,
- mitigation decisions and approval signoff.

Completed records are retained and made available to FAA upon request.

## 3) DAA and RPIC/VO interface
The revised ConOps explicitly defines:
- VO location qualification criteria,
- RPIC↔VO primary and backup communications,
- standard callouts and response actions,
- mission termination criteria when surveillance quality degrades.

## 4) 107.33 applicability
We acknowledge FAA’s note that §107.33 may be required based on the operation profile. The revised ConOps addresses VO support functions accordingly and we request FAA evaluate APP-922 with that applicability in view.

## 5) Minimum detection distance for DAA
The revised ConOps now includes a minimum practical detection objective and a corresponding avoidance/termination action matrix to ensure timely conflict response.

## 6) Non-shielding site qualification elements
The revised ConOps + Site Qualification Form now include the requested elements, including:
- controlled-access site criteria,
- Class G/COA handling,
- ADS-B In usage,
- VMC constraints,
- RPIC location requirements,
- Part 89 and unwaived Part 107 compliance,
- documented site survey fields (location, airspace, roads/access, obstacles, VO count/viewshed, OV, dock/LRS, C2 validation, downrange, 3 SM aviation activity),
- risk analysis cross-check and mitigation updates.

## Attachments uploaded with this RFI response
1. Revised Master ConOps for APP-922 non-geo California operations
2. Site Qualification Form template
3. (Optional) Updated hazard log/crosswalk

We appreciate the FAA’s guidance and are aligning this package to support a single California waiver framework for qualifying agricultural sites.

Respectfully,

Ethan Tarran
