DRAFT RFI RESPONSE — APP-922
To: FAA Part 107 Waiver Team (via ASP task: Submit Request for Information Response)
Applicant: Ethan Tarran
Application: APP-922
Date: 2026-02-25

Dear Part 107 Waiver Team,

Thank you for the Request for Information. Please accept this response and attached revised documents for APP-922.

1) Route of flight and factors affecting C2 / people / obstructions
- Revised ConOps defines route qualification and approval for non-site-specific operations.
- Routes are constrained to approved Operational Volume (OV) and evaluated against:
  - boundaries and no-fly constraints,
  - obstacle profile,
  - non-participant exposure/access points,
  - C2 sufficiency across route/OV.

2) Site qualification procedure for non-site-specific operations
- Added formal Site Qualification Procedure (SQP) in revised ConOps.
- Added Site Qualification Form template.
- Prior to initial operations at each site, we document:
  - hazards, boundaries, no-fly areas,
  - airspace classification,
  - obstructions,
  - roads/access points and people exposure,
  - VO placement/viewshed,
  - C2 validation,
  - mitigation decisions and approval signoff.
- Completed records are retained and available to FAA upon request.

3) DAA and RPIC/VO interface
- Revised ConOps now explicitly defines:
  - VO location qualification criteria,
  - RPIC↔VO primary and backup communications,
  - standard callouts and RPIC response actions,
  - mission termination criteria for degraded surveillance.

4) 107.33 applicability
- We acknowledge FAA’s note that §107.33 may be required based on operation profile.
- Revised ConOps addresses VO support functions accordingly.
- We request FAA evaluate APP-922 with that applicability in view.

5) Minimum detection distance for DAA
- Revised ConOps includes minimum practical detection objective and corresponding avoidance/termination action matrix to ensure timely conflict response.

6) Non-shielding site qualification elements
- Revised ConOps + Site Qualification Form include requested elements:
  - controlled-access site criteria,
  - Class G / COA handling,
  - ADS-B In usage,
  - VMC constraints,
  - RPIC location requirements,
  - Part 89 and unwaived Part 107 compliance,
  - documented site survey fields (location, airspace, roads/access, obstacles, VO count/viewshed, OV, dock/LRS, C2 validation, downrange, 3 SM aviation activity),
  - risk-analysis cross-check and mitigation updates.

Attachments uploaded with this RFI response:
- Revised Master ConOps for APP-922 non-geo California operations.
- Site Qualification Form template.
- Updated hazard-log/crosswalk (if included).

We appreciate the FAA’s guidance and have aligned this package to support a single California waiver framework for qualifying agricultural sites.

Respectfully,
Ethan Tarran
