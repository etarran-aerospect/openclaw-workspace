FAA RFI reference: APP-922 (dated 2/25/26)

---

## Executive assessment
Your package is strong on operational discipline, VO role, and contingency posture.  
The main deficiency is **non-site-specific governance**: FAA wants a documented statewide site-qualification framework embedded in CONOPS (with retained records), not just one-site appendices.

Secondary deficiency: your operation description likely requires **§107.33** treatment in addition to §107.31, and FAA explicitly flagged that.

## Requirement-by-requirement mapping

### 1) Route of flight / factors affecting C2, people, obstructions
**RFI asks:** route, and factors affecting C2 + overflight risk.

**Current status:** Partially addressed (site-specific language exists).

**Gap:** Need generalized process for non-geo operations: route authorization logic by site class, hazards, no-fly constraints, and C2 validation criteria.

**Fix in new CONOPS:**
- Add “Route Qualification & Approval Process” section.
- Require mission route review against site survey + hazard log before initial ops and whenever route changes.

---

### 2) Non-site-specific Site Qualification Procedure (must be in CONOPS)
**RFI asks:** documented method evaluating hazards, boundaries, no-fly areas, airspace, obstructions, roads/people; records retained.

**Current status:** Not complete for statewide non-geo framework.

**Gap:** You have site-specific artifacts, but not a standardized **California-wide qualification procedure + retained form template** as a system requirement.

**Fix in new CONOPS:**
- Add formal Site Qualification Procedure (SQP) for CA agricultural sites.
- Add mandatory Site Survey Form and records retention section.
- Include decision authority/signoff workflow.

---

### 3) DAA RPIC↔VO interface details
**RFI asks:** where VO is located; communications method; RPIC integration with DAA.

**Current status:** Mostly addressed in narrative/checklist.

**Gap:** FAA wants explicit procedural detail and verification method (not just general statements).

**Fix in new CONOPS:**
- Define VO placement criteria and viewshed acceptance test.
- Define primary and backup comm channels.
- Define mandatory callouts + response timeline.

---

### 4) §107.33 likely needed
**RFI asks:** operation appears to require 107.33 though not requested.

**Current status:** Potential mismatch.

**Gap:** Application scope should align with actual concept where VO cannot guarantee continuous visual acuity in all mission segments.

**Fix in response package:**
- Explicitly acknowledge and request FAA to evaluate with §107.33 where required by concept.
- In CONOPS: describe VO role under BVLOS support and tactical DAA.

---

### 5) Minimum detection distance for DAA
**RFI asks:** define minimum detection distance enabling avoidance strategy.

**Current status:** Missing numeric threshold.

**Gap:** No explicit minimum distance or reaction timeline.

**Fix in new CONOPS:**
- Add minimum manned-aircraft detection distance threshold and response logic.
- Tie threshold to immediate action matrix (hold/descend/terminate/recover).

---

### 6) Non-shielding site qualification bullets (FAA provided list)
**RFI asks:** include listed elements (private/controlled access, Class G or COA, ADS-B In use, VMC, RPIC location constraints, Part 89/107 compliance, survey details incl. 3sm aviation activity, C2 validation, etc.)

**Current status:** Some elements present, not fully formalized as auditable process.

**Gap:** Need explicit checklist and retained record with required fields.

**Fix in new package:**
- Site Qualification Form v1 (all FAA elements).
- Risk analysis linkage field (new hazards + mitigations).

---

## Immediate package recommendation
1. Revised CONOPS (non-geo CA, includes SQP + DAA specifics + records retention)
2. Site Qualification Form template
3. RFI response narrative cross-referenced to section numbers
4. Optional: one-page “Consolidation Request” statement (cancel remaining site applications after APP-922 approval)

---

## Confidence
- Strong path to approval if package is aligned exactly to FAA bullet list and you explicitly close the 107.33 + detection-distance gaps.
