## Scope + confidence
- FAA public issued-waivers table scraped: **1,891** rows; BVLOS subset (§107.31): **771** rows.
- FAA does not publish an official `non-geo` flag.
- **Known 12 list below is a best-effort roster** based on Jan-2024 public framing + operator lineage, not FAA-certified as an official category.
- Remaining list is a **rough shortlist of 58 likely additional approvals** through current table publication date.
