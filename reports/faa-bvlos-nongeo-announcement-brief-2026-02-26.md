# Non-Geo BVLOS Waiver Announcement Brief

Date: 2026-02-26

## Core claim (safe wording)

We are among **approximately 25 entities** identified in publicly available FAA records as holding this type of **non-geo BVLOS waiver**.

## Why "approximately"

FAA records update over time, and waiver language varies by holder. Using "approximately" keeps the statement accurate and defensible while still highlighting rarity.

## Short announcement options

1. "We’re proud to announce our California non-geo BVLOS waiver. Based on publicly available FAA records, we are among approximately 25 entities with this type of approval."

2. "With this California non-geo BVLOS waiver, we join a small group—roughly 25 entities identified in public FAA waiver records with comparable non-geo authorization language."

3. "Our new California non-geo BVLOS waiver places us in a very limited cohort, approximately 25 entities by our review of FAA public waiver records."

## If asked for methodology
