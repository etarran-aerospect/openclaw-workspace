# Slide Draft — Market Opportunity

## Title
**Market Opportunity**
**High-Value Infrastructure for a $2–3B Industry**

---

## Left Side: Market Context
- **600,000+ bearing acres** of wine grapes in California
- **$2–3B+ annual production value**
- Diverse segments: Central Valley (volume) to North Coast (premium)
- 2024 grape prices declined ~3% → margin pressure increasing

### Primary Market Drivers
- Rising labor costs
- Water constraints
- Input cost volatility
- Need to increase yield quality, not just tonnage

**In a cost-sensitive market, technologies that reduce inputs while increasing quality gain rapid attention.**

---

## Right Side: TAM → SOM Breakdown
### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- 600,000 acres ÷ 100 acres per dock ≈ **6,000 potential deployments**
- 6,000 docks × $24,000 ARR = **~$144M annual recurring revenue potential** (California alone)

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM – 5 Year Horizon)
- If adopted by 10% of premium acreage (~60,000 acres):
- ~600 docks ≈ **$14.4M ARR**
- Premium-focused expansion + enterprise accounts → **$100M+ long-term revenue opportunity** as deployment scales across California and West Coast regions
