## Slide Title
**Market Opportunity**  
**High-Value Infrastructure for a $2–3B Industry**

## Left Column — Why This Market Is Ready
California’s wine grape sector spans **600,000+ bearing acres** and generates **$2–3B+** in annual production value. It includes both high-volume operations in the Central Valley and premium-focused vineyards in the North Coast.

In 2024, grape prices declined by ~3%, increasing pressure on margins. At the same time, vineyard operators face rising labor costs, tightening water availability, and volatile input costs. As a result, growers are prioritizing solutions that improve **quality-adjusted yield** while reducing preventable spend.

**Market Signal:** Growers don’t need more imagery—they need decision-ready guidance that lowers cost and protects crop value.

## Right Column — TAM to SOM
### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- 600,000 acres ÷ 100 acres per dock ≈ **6,000 potential deployments**
- 6,000 docks × $24,000 ARR = **~$144M annual recurring revenue potential** (California only)

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM, 5-Year Horizon)
- 10% premium acreage adoption (~60,000 acres)
- ~600 docks ≈ **$14.4M ARR**
- Premium-first scaling + enterprise account penetration creates a path to **$100M+ long-term revenue** across California and broader West Coast regions
