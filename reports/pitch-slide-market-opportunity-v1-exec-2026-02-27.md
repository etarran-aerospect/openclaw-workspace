**Market Opportunity**  
**High-Value Infrastructure for a $2–3B Industry**

## Left Column — Market Context
- **600,000+** bearing acres (California wine grapes)
- **$2–3B+** annual production value
- Central Valley (volume) → North Coast (premium)
- 2024 grape prices **down ~3%** (margin pressure rising)

### Market Drivers
- Rising labor costs
- Water constraints
- Input cost volatility
- Quality-per-acre matters more than raw tonnage

**Takeaway:** Cost reduction + quality improvement technologies are being adopted faster.

## Right Column — TAM to SOM
### TAM (California)
- 600,000 acres / 100 acres per dock = **~6,000 deployments**
- 6,000 × $24,000 ARR = **~$144M ARR potential**

### SOM (5-Year)
- 10% premium acreage adoption (~60,000 acres)
- **~600 docks = ~$14.4M ARR**
- Enterprise expansion path to **$100M+ long-term revenue**
