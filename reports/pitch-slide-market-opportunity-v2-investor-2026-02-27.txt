MARKET OPPORTUNITY
High-Value Infrastructure for a $2–3B Industry

LEFT COLUMN — WHY THIS MARKET IS READY
California’s wine grape sector spans 600,000+ bearing acres and generates $2–3B+ in annual production value.
The market includes high-volume operations in the Central Valley and premium-focused vineyards in the North Coast.

In 2024, grape prices declined by ~3%, increasing margin pressure. At the same time, vineyard operators face rising labor costs,
water constraints, and input cost volatility. Growers are actively prioritizing solutions that improve quality-adjusted yield while reducing preventable spend.

MARKET SIGNAL
Growers do not need more imagery. They need decision-ready guidance that lowers cost and protects crop value.
