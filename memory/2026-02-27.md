## ChatGPT + Drive handoff workflow setup
- Resolved `gog` non-interactive auth issue for OpenClaw by adding `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` to `systemd --user` override for `openclaw-gateway`.
- Uploaded website handoff package to Google Drive folder:
  - `AeroSpect Website Handoff 2026-02-26` (kept folder ID: `140bgOHmhQlIuW8NpI3kQbpBW5z-wQCYh`).
- Created `AI-Handoffs` workflow folder (kept folder ID: `12i5sOnnKRZQO3SahByrIG4DZvmMTEnZH`) with:
  - `INBOX.md`
  - `SPEC.md`
  - `DONE.md`
  - `HOW-TO-USE-AI-HANDOFFS.md`
- Duplicate Drive folders were identified and trashed with Ethan's explicit approval.

## Workflow decisions
- Goal: robust, minimal copy/paste bridge between ChatGPT and Claw using shared Google Drive docs.
- Recommended pattern: ChatGPT seat generates structured INBOX output; Claw converts to SPEC and executes; DONE tracks completion.
- AI-Handoffs should be shared only as needed (least-privilege).

## Important account detail to remember
- Second ChatGPT seat account email: `joe.brown@aerospectinc.com`.

## ChatGPT Team seat question
- Ethan asked if Claw can be connected to / “use” the second seat on ChatGPT Team/Business.
- Conclusion: seats are for humans; agent can’t natively consume the extra seat entitlement.
- Practical alternatives: invite a real collaborator, downgrade to single-user plan, or use Browser Relay/API for automation needs.

## Website finalization progress
- Created website finalization assets in `reports/website-handoff-2026-02-26/`:
  - `website-finalization-runbook-2026-02-27.md`
  - `lovable-compact-input-2026-02-27.md`
  - `website-manual-qa-checklist-10min-2026-02-27.md`
- Headline direction selected:
  - `Actionable Vineyard Intelligence. Powered by Advanced Aerial Imaging.`
- Supporting paragraph selected:
  - `Vineyard managers don’t need more maps. They need clear answers. AeroSpect delivers structured vineyard intelligence reports that identify irrigation issues, stress zones, disease pressure, and yield variability, so you can act early and with confidence.`
- Added hero image candidate into workspace:
  - `src/assets/m300-over-vines.png`

## Pitch deck work
- Drafted Market Opportunity slide in two styles (exec + investor) and uploaded to Drive folder:
  - `Pitch Deck Slide Drafts 2026-02-27` (`1N8Ch6idbQLjnfP9RimmS502FOPiDUxmi`)
- Uploaded both `.md` and plain-text `.txt` versions for direct slide copy/paste.

## OpenClaw maintenance
- Gateway restart update: ok (npm).
- Ran `openclaw doctor --non-interactive`:
  - Found 3 orphan transcript files under `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions` (not referenced by `sessions.json`).
  - Found 1 live session lock file (not stale).
  - No channel security warnings.
  - Memory search enabled but no embedding provider configured (no API keys set for embeddings).
- Workspace sync status: branch up-to-date; added `tmp/` to `.gitignore` to stop tracking scratch PDFs.
