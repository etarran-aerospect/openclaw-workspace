## ChatGPT + Drive handoff workflow setup
- Resolved `gog` non-interactive auth issue for OpenClaw by adding `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` to `systemd --user` override for `openclaw-gateway`.
- Uploaded website handoff package to Google Drive folder:
  - `AeroSpect Website Handoff 2026-02-26` (kept folder ID: `140bgOHmhQlIuW8NpI3kQbpBW5z-wQCYh`).
- Created `AI-Handoffs` workflow folder (kept folder ID: `12i5sOnnKRZQO3SahByrIG4DZvmMTEnZH`) with:
  - `INBOX.md`
  - `SPEC.md`
  - `DONE.md`
  - `HOW-TO-USE-AI-HANDOFFS.md`
- Duplicate Drive folders were identified and trashed with Ethan's explicit approval.

## Workflow decisions
- Goal: robust, minimal copy/paste bridge between ChatGPT and Claw using shared Google Drive docs.
- Recommended pattern: ChatGPT seat generates structured INBOX output; Claw converts to SPEC and executes; DONE tracks completion.
- AI-Handoffs should be shared only as needed (least-privilege).

## Important account detail to remember
- Second ChatGPT seat account email: `joe.brown@aerospectinc.com`.

## Website finalization progress
