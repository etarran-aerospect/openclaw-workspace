## Context / project
- Ethan provides drone imaging (thermal + multispectral) for vineyards and wants to deliver high-confidence, actionable weekly insights (not just NDVI maps).
- Deliverable concept: weekly generated crop health report + companion app.
  - Map overview of the whole vineyard with pins at locations needing attention.
  - Severity scale: Extreme → Investigate.
  - Actions describe likely issue + priority (Irrigation vs Scouting).
  - Executive Summary for vineyard manager.

## Work completed today
- Confirmed QGIS version: 3.40.10.
- Established WSL access to Windows drive paths via /mnt/<drive>.
- Implemented v1 static HTML report generator for Barrelli Creek Block A02.
  - Clean RGB default with numbered pins + side panel.
  - NDVI and thermal inspection layers colorized.
  - Percentile-based fusion for candidate pins (block-relative): NDVI p<=20 AND Thermal p>=80 ("Balanced").
  - Added per-pin NDVI/Thermal percentiles in the panel.
  - Improved layout for iPad: map + selected pin panel on left; executive summary on right.
  - Pins can be deselected (click again or click map background).
  - Rotated map -21deg and tuned translate/scale to reduce cropping.

## Temporal demo
- Built temporal viewer for dates: 2025-06-16, 2025-07-03, 2025-08-04, 2025-09-02.
  - For 2025-09-02, standardized to 1pm thermal (solar noon) internally.
