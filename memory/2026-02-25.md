- Checked OpenClaw status on desktop (`Claw-Desktop`): workspace git pull --rebase OK; sync-check up-to-date; Telegram channel ON/OK.
- Security audit: 0 critical; WARN about reverse proxy headers not trusted (gateway.bind loopback; trustedProxies empty).
- Conway MCP bridge health check:
  - credits_balance: $0.00
  - sandbox_list: [] (no sandboxes visible)
  - Confirmed via user: sandbox 2efde0b72499535ba36a13f786ed7493 is RUNNING; UI billing wallet 0xcA7B39…eAeC and operator wallet Repo-Audit-1 0x268843…9E92.
- Root cause of OpenClaw↔Conway mismatch: mcporter config had a hardcoded API key; temporary env overrides did not apply as expected. Fix: removed hardcoded CONWAY_API_KEY from ~/.mcporter/mcporter.json; updated ~/.conway/config.json to a working key so conway-mcp can sandbox_get/exec again.
- Repo-Audit-1 was burning credits via cron: root crontab ran /root/.automaton/run-burst.sh every 15 minutes (check_credits loop). Disabled by commenting out the line and backing up crontab.
- Funded $1 (credits to ~$1.09). Manual bursts run via /root/.automaton/run-burst.sh; create_goal temporarily enabled to create goal 01KJB6HP6YJW5E5STR2ADBDP0W (deploy minimal public inbound repo-audit intake service).
- Cleared stale /root/.automaton/run-burst.lock; longer run showed work and staged /root/.automaton/public and intake docs. Started a dedicated python http.server on port 8787 serving /root/.automaton/public; created index.html; copied INBOUND_SERVICE_PAGE.md/README_QUICK_AUDIT.md/intake_template.md/OFFER.md into served dir; verified public URL works.
- Notes: ports 8000/8080 were returning 502; canonical endpoint is https://8787-2efde0b72499535ba36a13f786ed7493.life.conway.tech/.
