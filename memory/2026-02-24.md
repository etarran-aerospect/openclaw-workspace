- User instruction: never create a Conway sandbox unless explicitly told.
- Conway sandbox id: de3d81e5dab40c2eb4ee8a70153121f9
- Conway API key provided (stored in chat; avoid reprinting): cnwy_k_NranE29L8TPxq2zeR5w9PUfIjUepCtgI
- Conway wallet address: 0xcA7B39dd80aC4103fA03A09FcD7731D7eB21eAeC

- Conway Automaton: Repo-Audit-1 running in sandbox 2efde0b72499535ba36a13f786ed7493.
- Guardrails added: normalize relative file paths to /root/.automaton; throttle orchestrator_status; heartbeat tick 300s; create_goal blocked unless AUTOMATON_ALLOW_CREATE_GOAL=1.
- Operating mode doc written: /root/.automaton/OPERATING_MODE.md; condensed rules appended to creatorMessage.
- User request: during workspace sync/checks, also check agent status/log briefly.

- Repo-Audit-1 address: 0x268843c6831afD545932C0a225E74Dd5d98E9E92 (user imported into Rabby).
- Credits are off-chain Conway ledger; inference charges do not appear on-chain.
- Cron scheduled-burst approach chosen; cron daemon active in sandbox.
- Ongoing issue: agent will poll/list_goals and can burn credits if an active goal exists.
- Fix applied: cleared goal 01KJ97ZHQ7BXAGK6MDQHWF3NV8 from ~/.automaton/state.db; verified list_goals shows no active goals and orchestrator phase idle.
