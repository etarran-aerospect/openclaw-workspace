## 2026-02-24

- User instruction: never create a Conway sandbox unless explicitly told.
- Conway sandbox id: `de3d81e5dab40c2eb4ee8a70153121f9`.
- Conway wallet address used in session: `0xcA7B39dd80aC4103fA03A09FcD7731D7eB21eAeC`.

- Conway Automaton: Repo-Audit-1 running in sandbox `2efde0b72499535ba36a13f786ed7493`.
- Guardrails added: normalize relative file paths to `/root/.automaton`; throttle `orchestrator_status`; heartbeat tick 300s; `create_goal` blocked unless `AUTOMATON_ALLOW_CREATE_GOAL=1`.
- Operating mode doc written: `/root/.automaton/OPERATING_MODE.md`; condensed rules appended to `creatorMessage`.
- User request: during workspace sync/checks, also check agent status/log briefly.

- Repo-Audit-1 address: `0x268843c6831afD545932C0a225E74Dd5d98E9E92` (user imported into Rabby).
- Credits are off-chain Conway ledger; inference charges do not appear on-chain.
- Cron scheduled-burst approach chosen; cron daemon active in sandbox.
- Ongoing issue observed: agent can poll/list_goals and burn credits if an active goal exists.
- Fix applied: cleared goal `01KJ97ZHQ7BXAGK6MDQHWF3NV8` from `~/.automaton/state.db`; verified `list_goals` shows no active goals and orchestrator phase idle.

## OpenClaw + Conway MCP findings

- OpenClaw builds tested (2026.2.20 and 2026.2.23) do **not** support `mcpServers` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (validation: unknown key).
- Working integration path: `mcporter` + `conway-terminal` (stdio).
- Desktop setup completed with local Conway config and verified `mcporter` calls.
- `mcporter generate-cli` output was TS-flavored (`as const`) and failed under node; wrapper approach preferred.

## Workspace sync / identity updates

- Added git sync helper + guardrail flow:
  - `scripts/workspace-sync-check.sh`
  - AGENTS.md startup checklist now includes `git pull --rebase` + sync check.
- Added shared Conway bootstrap docs/scripts (secret-safe):
  - `docs/conway-setup.md`
  - `scripts/setup-conway.sh` (uses `CONWAY_API_KEY` env var)
- Local identity updated: machine `Ethans-Laptop`, agent identity `Claw-Laptop`.
- Telegram + WhatsApp confirmed ON/OK on laptop after repairs.

## Sandbox reliability note

- Sandbox `de3d81e5dab40c2eb4ee8a70153121f9` repeatedly showed `running` while exec/PTY failed with `kex_exchange_identification` / SSH reset; likely infra-side instability.

## FAA BVLOS research artifacts

- Report saved: `reports/faa-nongeo-phrase-table.md`.
- Raw intermediate parsing artifacts were generated in `/tmp` during session.
