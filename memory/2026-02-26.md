# 2026-02-26

## FAA BVLOS non-geo waiver work
- Re-ran and refined phrase-based screening for Part 107 §107.31 waivers.
- Produced multiple reports and a top-25 working list for messaging:
  - `reports/faa-bvlos-nongeo-top25-2026-02-26.md`

## Website migration prep (AeroSpect)
- User wants to move Google Sites/hosted site style into a normal codebase (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind) using Lovable.
- Built comprehensive prompt pack + NDVI overlay data + asset checklist for handoff tomorrow.
- Bundle created at:
  - `reports/website-handoff-2026-02-26/`
    - `lovable-prompts-pack-2026-02-26.md`
    - `ndvi-overlay-data-2026-02-26.ts`
    - `asset-handoff-checklist-2026-02-26.md`
- Core concept to implement on site: show NDVI (confusing) vs RGB action map (clear actions: Irrigation Needed, Pest/Disease Pressure, Irrigation Leak).

## RIFFAI / Petch meeting prep
- Ethan has a 30-min exploratory meeting with **Petch Ounjaroen (Stanford undergrad; COO/cofounder of RIFFAI)** via mutual connection **Solomon Kim (sunscreen.energy)**.
- Ethan’s startup concept: **AeroSpect** — autonomous drone imaging + analyses for vineyards/permanent crops; long-term scaling via **drone docks**. Currently doing **manual drone capture**; recently received a **non-geographic BVLOS waiver for California**.
- Goal for meeting: communicate high-level capability + credibility; propose partnership where Ethan provides **high-resolution UAV ground truth** to validate/train RIFFAI’s **polygon scoring/monitoring** outputs; vineyards as initial proving ground.

## RIFFAI materials reviewed
- riffai.org marketing site: Satellite intelligence powered by AI; market segments include renewable energy, environment, defense/intelligence, urban settlement, industry.
- LabLab submission (Launch Fund AI meets Robotics):
  - Short description: satellite images to train automated decision-making AI for **site search/selection for energy developers**.
  - Pipeline described: multi-source imagery (GEE + providers) + weather + customer training sets; fast geo/metadata alignment; segmentation (U-Net/CNN) + time-series forecasting (LSTM); outputs explainable suitability scores and ranked polygons; UI/API; monitoring alert examples (thermal anomaly / vegetation/water change).
  - Links: https://github.com/RIFFAI-org/ ; demo https://www.riffai.tech/ (Next.js + Clerk auth)
- PDF presentation (Canva) extracted text: “Satellite x AI for Energy Site Intelligence,” use cases focused on wind/solar; problem framing around energy project delays; tech stack mentions YOLO + GPT-4/5 + Gemini + Vercel + MongoDB.

## Ops / workspace
- Fixed IDENTITY.md to Name: Claw-Desktop earlier; committed/pushed.
- User removed GitHub repo website links / Vercel exposure for AeroSpect sites.

## User intent for tomorrow
- Continue from the website handoff package.
- Keep prompts and component specs ready for Lovable execution and iteration.
