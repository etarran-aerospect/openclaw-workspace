# 2026-02-26

## FAA BVLOS non-geo waiver work
- Re-ran and refined phrase-based screening for Part 107 §107.31 waivers.
- Produced multiple reports and a top-25 working list for messaging:
  - `reports/faa-bvlos-nongeo-top25-2026-02-26.md`

## Website migration prep (AeroSpect)
- User wants to move Google Sites/hosted site style into a normal codebase (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind) using Lovable.
- Built comprehensive prompt pack + NDVI overlay data + asset checklist for handoff tomorrow.
- Bundle created at:
  - `reports/website-handoff-2026-02-26/`
    - `lovable-prompts-pack-2026-02-26.md`
    - `ndvi-overlay-data-2026-02-26.ts`
    - `asset-handoff-checklist-2026-02-26.md`
- Core concept to implement on site: show NDVI (confusing) vs RGB action map (clear actions: Irrigation Needed, Pest/Disease Pressure, Irrigation Leak).

## User intent for tomorrow
- Continue from this website handoff package.
- Keep prompts and component specs ready for Lovable execution and iteration.
